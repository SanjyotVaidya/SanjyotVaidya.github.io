Found an interesting way while coding... some backstory

## What is branch prediction in computer architecture?

How CPU runs on branch prediction
Gobolt implementation on if else
What CPU is running in instructions

## GCC keywords

After using likely and unlikely how CPU is doing branch prediciton
